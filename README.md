# Pawfect Match

I did some work building a app to match dogs with users. Since I was proud of my work Ive decided to continue building, with plans to refactor using the The Petfinder API. This API allows access the Petfinder database of hundreds of thousands of pets ready for adoption and over ten thousand animal welfare organizations.
